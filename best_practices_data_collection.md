# Best Practices for Data Collection

## Criteria for Sufficient Data Collection

To ensure the development of a robust Language Learning Model (LLM) for Kenyan indigenous languages, the following criteria for data collection are established:

### Diversity
- The dataset must include a wide range of dialects, accents, and linguistic nuances.
- Data should be collected from various regions and communities to capture the full spectrum of language use.

### Representativeness
- The data must accurately reflect the real-world application and usage of the languages across different contexts.
- It should include contributions from speakers of all ages, genders, and socio-economic backgrounds.

### Balance
- A balanced compilation of different types of data (text and voice) is essential.
- The dataset should not be skewed towards one type of data or one particular aspect of language.

### Quality and Accuracy
- High-quality audio recordings and clear, well-written text samples are crucial.
- The data must be verified for accuracy and annotated correctly, where applicable.

### Ethical Considerations
- Informed consent must be obtained from all participants contributing data.
- Data collection processes should respect the cultural significance and intellectual property rights of the language communities.

### Quantity
- The dataset should consist of a substantial number of samples to train the LLM effectively.
- A target of thousands to hundreds of thousands of sentences/utterances is recommended, depending on the complexity of the language features.

### Iterative Evaluation
- Regular evaluation of the model's performance should be conducted to assess the effectiveness of the collected data.
- Adjustments to the data collection strategy may be necessary based on these evaluations.

By adhering to these criteria, the LLM project aims to create a comprehensive and culturally sensitive language model that serves the needs of the Kenyan indigenous language communities.
