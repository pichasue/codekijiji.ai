# NLP Cost Estimate for Kikuyu Language Model

## Overview
This document provides a preliminary cost estimate for developing a custom Natural Language Processing (NLP) solution for the Kikuyu language. The estimate covers the costs associated with data collection, annotation, model training, deployment, and prediction services using Google Cloud's Vertex AI.

## Data Collection
- **Estimated Size**: TBD GB of text and audio data
- **Estimated Cost**: Free (if collected via web application and stored in Google Cloud Storage within the free tier limits)

## Data Annotation
- **Estimated Hours**: TBD hours (based on the amount of data and complexity of the language)
- **Estimated Cost**: TBD (cost will vary based on the method of annotation, e.g., manual annotation by language experts or automated tools)

## Model Training
- **Machine Type**: n1-standard-4 (as a starting point)
- **Estimated Training Time**: TBD hours
- **Training Cost per Hour**: $0.218499 (as per Vertex AI pricing)
- **Total Estimated Training Cost**: TBD (calculated as Training Cost per Hour * Estimated Training Time)

## Model Deployment
- **Machine Type for Endpoint**: n1-standard-4
- **Estimated Deployment Time**: TBD hours/month
- **Deployment Cost per Hour**: $0.218499
- **Total Estimated Deployment Cost**: TBD (calculated as Deployment Cost per Hour * Estimated Deployment Time)

## Prediction Services
- **Estimated Number of Predictions per Month**: TBD
- **Prediction Cost**: TBD (based on the number of predictions and the resources required to process them)

## Additional Costs
- **Storage Costs**: TBD (based on the size of the dataset and the duration of storage)
- **Accelerators**: TBD (if high-performance GPUs or TPUs are required)
- **Other Google Cloud Resources**: TBD (e.g., BigQuery for data analysis, additional compute resources)

## Summary
The total cost of developing a custom NLP solution for the Kikuyu language will be the sum of the costs for data collection, annotation, model training, deployment, and prediction services. Additional costs will include storage and any other Google Cloud resources used.

**Total Estimated Cost**: TBD

> Note: The actual costs may vary based on the final scale of the project, the complexity of the model, and the actual resource usage. This estimate will be refined as more detailed information becomes available.
