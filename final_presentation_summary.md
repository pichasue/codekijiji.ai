# Final Presentation Summary: Kikuyu TTS System Integration

## Introduction
This presentation summarizes the key components and steps taken to develop and integrate a Text-to-Speech (TTS) system for the Kikuyu language. The project's goal was to create a TTS system that can translate text into spoken Kikuyu, focusing on translations, voiceovers, and data analysis for model training.

## Key Components
- **Web Application**: Deployed a React web application `tts-frontend` on Netlify, providing a user interface for the TTS system.
- **AWS Management**: Uploaded Kikuyu language MP3 files to the S3 bucket `codekijiji-ai-kikuyu-tts-data` for model training.
- **Docker Configuration**: Set up a Docker container with essential tools like Miniconda, MFA, Pynini, TensorFlow, HTK, and HDecode for TTS processing.
- **Backend Connectivity**: Updated `KikuyuTTSComponent.js` to connect with the backend service endpoint for TTS processing.
- **Nginx Configuration**: Configured an Nginx server to serve the Flask application over HTTPS, ensuring secure communication.

## Steps Taken
1. **Deployment**: Launched the `tts-frontend` React web application on Netlify with a focus on user experience and functionality.
2. **Technical Resolutions**: Addressed various technical issues, including Docker container and port conflicts, and confirmed the functionality of the TTS endpoint.
3. **Data Preparation**: Downloaded and prepared Kikuyu Bible translations audio files for TTS model training, ensuring a rich dataset for accurate model training.
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Monitored the system's performance to ensure operational stability and efficiency.

## Final Integration
- **Flask Application**: Ensured the Flask application was accessible and running on the correct port within the Docker container.
- **System Testing**: Conducted thorough testing of the TTS system, including the `/api/tts` endpoint, to validate the integration.
- **Git Management**: Made frequent commits to track changes and maintain a clear history of the project's development.

## Conclusion
The Kikuyu TTS system integration project successfully combined web development, cloud management, containerization, and data processing to create a functional TTS system. The system is now ready for final review and demonstration.

## Next Steps
- Review the final presentation with stakeholders.
- Gather feedback and make any necessary adjustments.
- Prepare for the official launch of the TTS system.
